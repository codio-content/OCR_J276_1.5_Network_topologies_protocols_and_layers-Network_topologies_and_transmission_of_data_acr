Ethernet is a group of technologies used for the transmission of data on cable LANs. Ethernet was originally designed for coaxial cable but updates of the technology function on twisted pair and fibre optic.

Ethernet includes the **protocols** – the rules that must be followed so that the data can be formatted and transmitted in packets called **frames**.
The Ethernet protocol specifies a set of rules for constructing frames. There are explicit minimum and maximum lengths for frames, and a set of required pieces of information that must appear in each one.

Each Ethernet packet contains an Ethernet frame which consists of: 

- A header containing the source and destination MAC addresses.
- The data being transmitted.
- An FRP (Frame Check Sequence) used to detect any corruption of data.
