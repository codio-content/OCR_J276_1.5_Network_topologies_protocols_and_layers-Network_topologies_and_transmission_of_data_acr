In a mesh network the nodes are connected to each other.
If it is a **full mesh network** then each node is connected to all of the others but in a partial mesh network they are connected to only those with which they exchange the most data.

**A full mesh topology**

**A partial mesh topology**

Each of the network nodes, servers, client computers and printers, are interconnected with one another. 
Every node not only sends its own signals but also relays data from other nodes as they are all interconnected.

## Advantages of using a mesh network

- Data can be transmitted from different devices simultaneously.
- There are alternative routes across the network. Even if one of the components fails there is always an alternative route for the data.
- It can handle high volumes of data traffic.
- Adding more devices will not hamper the transmission of data as all nodes help to transmit the data.

## Disadvantages of using a mesh network

- There is a high probability of redundancy in many of the network connections which are never used.
- Overall cost of this network is way too high as compared to other topologies. 
- Set-up, maintenance and administration of this topology is very difficult and requires specialist knowledge.
