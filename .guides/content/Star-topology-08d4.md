In a star topology, each computer is connected individually to a central point, which can be a file server (if it is a client-server) network or switch.

In a star network each node is connected individually to a file server or switch.
The switches can also be connected to other switches to produce a cascading arrangement. Using this method a LAN could have a central switch and then a switch for each computer room or office.

## Advantages of using a star network

- Data packets can be directed to the intended node directly without having to pass along the complete network. 
There will be less network traffic and fewer collisions.
- Adding or removing devices is easy, and can be done without affecting the entire network as there is no central cable that must not be disconnected.
- If one link fails then all of the others will continue to operate.

## Disadvantages of using a star network

- Network operation depends on the central component (file server or switch) and if this fails, then so will the entire network.
- It requires more cable length than a simple topology where the computers are connected in a line and so it is more expensive.
