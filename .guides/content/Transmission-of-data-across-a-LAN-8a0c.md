Data is transmitted across networks in chunks called **data packets** using different technologies depending on whether it is a wired or wireless network.

Each device on a LAN must have an address so that the data can be delivered. 
On a LAN, these addresses are provided by the **MAC** (Media Access Control) address.
Every device is created with a MAC or hardware device permanently ‘burned’ into it.
Every MAC address is unique so that all data on a network can be sent to the correct component, just like letters delivered to the correct house.

MAC addresses are 48 bits in length and are usually displayed as a 12-digit hexadecimal number.
