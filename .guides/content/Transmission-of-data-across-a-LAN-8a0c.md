Data is transmitted across networks in chunks called **data packets** using different technologies depending on whether it is a wired or wireless network.

Each device on a LAN must have an address so that the data can be delivered to the right place. 

On a LAN, these addresses are provided by the IP address (Internet Protocol). 

Each device has a unique IP address on that network. 

Additionally, each piece of hardware (like a network card) on the LAN has a MAC (Media Access Control) address that is unique to that bit of hardware and the address is permanently “burned” into it.  

Every MAC address is unique so that all data on a network can be sent to the correct component, just like letters delivered to the correct house(IP address) and also going into the right letter box (MAC address).

MAC addresses are 48 bits in length and are usually displayed as a 12-digit hexadecimal number.
