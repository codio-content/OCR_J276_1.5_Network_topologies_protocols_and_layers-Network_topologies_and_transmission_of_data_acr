Wi-Fi is a group of technologies and protocols that allow devices to connect to a wireless LAN (WLAN) using radio waves.
Wi-Fi is the wireless equivalent of Ethernet.

Radio waves are a type of microwave and they are used to transmit data across networks in frequencies of between 2.4 and 5GHz. 

Each frequency range is divided into separate channels. For example, in the 2.4GHz range used in most networks, there are 14 channels spaced 5MHz apart. Devices operating on channels close to each other may cause interference and so users can change the operating channel of their Wi-Fi device.

Wi-Fi is less secure than wired connections because an intruder does not need a physical connection and does not even have to be in the building. They could be able to log in from the street!
Wireless security or encryption is used. The early method WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) was easy to crack and the higher quality protocols WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access and WPA2) are now used.
